//These vars store data for readLine. They're
// not local static vars because we want other
// functions to see them.

/*First, since it's needed to build values, the flags.
 * These are used to define the type of instruction
 * parsed by the interpreter. These dictate how the
 * numbers in InstructionIdentifiers are chosen. The
 * flags are defined with ambiguity to allow them to
 * fit the descriptions of a large range of different
 * instruction types. 
 * 
 * Tatoeba, a func call is standard code, instructs,
 * deals with existance (grabs an existing resource),
 * is an operation, is one piece, has args
 * (for >Terminal_, the possibility is enough),
 * contains a resource (it references a resource name),
 * and is complete in its normal form. So, 0x00 is a
 * func call.
 *
 * Some specific data here for dictating which flags
 * are used when:
 *  creates data  - instruction of existance
 *  destroys data - manipulation of existance
 *  assigns data  - instruction of value
 *  edits data    - manipulation of value
 *  if more actions are required, it is incomplete. 
 *   Tatoeba, declarations are incomplete because
 *   even though they make the variable, it doesn't
 *   have any data to give it, so it needs to be
 *   followed up with a definition.
