//These vars store data for readLine(). They're not local static vars because we want other functions to see them.

/*First, since it's needed to build values, the flags. These are used to define the type of instruction
 * parsed by the interpreter. These dictate how the numbers in InstructionIdentifiers are chosen. The
 * flags are defined with ambiguity to allow them to fit the descriptions of a large range of different
 * instruction types. 
 * 
 * Tatoeba, a func call is standard code, instructs, deals with existance (grabs an existing resource),
 * is an operation, is one piece, has args (for >Terminal_, the possibility is enough), contains a resource
 * (it references a resource name), and is complete in its normal form. So, 0x00 is a
 * func call.
 * 
 * Some specific data here for dictating which flags are used in specific cases:
 *  creates data    - instruction of existance
 *  destroys data   - manipulation of existance
 *  loads/&c data   - instruction of value, references, singular
 *  edits data      - manipulation of value
 *  deals w/ funcs  - has arguments
 *  declaration     - singular, incomplete, standalone
 *  
 *  if more actions are required, it is incomplete. Tatoeba, declarations are incomplete because even though they make the
 *   variable, it doesn't have any data to give it, so it needs to be followed up with a definition.
