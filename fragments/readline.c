/*
 * MAIN DEVELOPMENT NOTE:
 *
 * Currently, the most struggle is with being able to
 * differentiate different types of instructions with
 * a single struct. During thinking about the
 * similarities between them, I remembered the one
 * thing that should be common sense and completely
 * obvious, at least to me; the entire time I've been
 * talking about how (at least in C's case) everything
 * boils down to math. Even in the eyes of the general
 * public, programming is seen as (more-or-less) math
 * with words. This is totally the case.
 *
 * At the next earliest oppurtunity to edit the
 * instruction-based structures, change these to be
 * (almost) entirely math. Even function calls are
 * math, and should be treated as such.
 *
 * Instructions that can't really be treated as math
 * (at least not easily), ie data declarations, 
 * pre-processor instructions, and flow control 
 * (for, while, if, etc), can be treated differently.
 * Because of these cases (and the fact that one
 * instruction can do more than one type of action)
 * the current structure works fine, it just needs to
 * be tweaked to be math-central and properly mark what
 * actions need to be carried out instead of trying to
 * categorize equations.
